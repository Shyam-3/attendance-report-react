# 📊 Attendance Management System

A modern, full-stack web application for managing student attendance records with powerful filtering, analytics, and export capabilities.

## 🎯 What is this project?

This is a complete **Attendance Management System** built with a Flask backend (REST API) and React frontend (TypeScript + Vite). It allows educational institutions to:

- **Upload** student attendance data from Excel files (including bulk uploads via ZIP files)
- **Track** attendance percentages across multiple courses
- **Filter** students by course, attendance threshold, or search criteria
- **Exclude** specific courses from analysis
- **Export** filtered data to professionally formatted Excel and PDF reports
- **Manage** records with individual delete and bulk clear operations

The system provides real-time statistics, color-coded attendance indicators, and an intuitive dashboard for quick insights into student performance.

### 📊 Dashboard & Analytics
- **Real-time statistics cards**:
  - Total students / Filtered student count
  - Active courses / Selected course details
  - Students below 75% attendance
  - Critical students (below 65% attendance)
- **Advanced filtering**:
  - Filter by specific course or view all courses
  - Filter by attendance threshold (below 75%, below 65%, or all students)
  - Search students by registration number or name
  - Exclude multiple courses from view (when viewing all courses)
- **Interactive data table**:
  - Color-coded rows (green ≥75%, yellow 65-75%, red <65%)
  - Sortable columns
  - Hover-to-open dropdown filters
  - Click-to-pin dropdown filters

### 📥 Export Capabilities
- **Excel Export**: Professionally formatted with styled headers, auto-sized columns, and colored rows
- **PDF Export**: Clean reports with title, filter information, colored rows, and timestamp footer
- **Filtered exports**: Exports respect all active filters (course, threshold, search, exclude)
- **Timestamped filenames**: Automatic naming with date and filter info

### 🔧 Data Management
- **Individual record deletion**: Remove specific attendance records
- **Bulk data clearing**: Clear all data with confirmation prompt
- **Real-time updates**: UI updates immediately after data modifications

   ```
   The backend API will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

4. **Open in browser**:
   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5173`

### Configuration (Optional)

- **Frontend API URL**: Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `frontend/.env` if backend runs on a different port
- **Backend CORS**: Set `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable if frontend runs on a different port
